# REST Local File

The goal of this exercise is to create a simple application that will allow the manipulation of data in a "local database" in the form of a CSV file.

## Functionality

The CSV file is already included in the program directory. Inside is a collection of records of student data. The app should allow five different operations:
- Receive a list of all records
- Receive data about a specific student using their Id
- Update data about a specific student using their Id
- Add a new record
- Delete a record using the student's Id

## Requirements

The data manipulation does not need to update the CSV file itself, it simply serves as a simulation of working on a database using a dataset.

When updating or adding a student, all fields must be provided.
